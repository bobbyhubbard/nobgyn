# NOBGYN stands for Northland Obstetrics and Gynecology.

## Overview

This document explains the purpose of the NOBGYN repository. Its a simple project which includes fairly straight forward code.

## Language(s)

The primary language of this repo is python utilizing the Django framework for the web and api runtimes.

## Hosting

NOBGYN is hosted via Amazon Web Services LightSail and is currently configured with a single server instance with nightly backups.

## Why Django

Django was selected primarily because I wanted to learn Python at the time and Django was a good option for templatizing a static website for consistency and simple data entry.

It also allowed the client the ability to go into an admin console and update certain content sets themselves.

## Setup

<br/>

Be sure to update the following credentials at deployment time.
