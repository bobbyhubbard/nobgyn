5,positive_afp_triple_screen,1,I have a positive AFP or triple screen test for Down's Syndrome. What does that mean?,"<p>This means that the blood test has determined that your pregnancy has the same risk or higher as that of a 35-year old of being affected by Down's Syndrome.  It is not diagnostic.  This test is a screening test and is intended to delineate which patients should be offered further testing. </p>
<p>The most common reason for a positive result is the dates of the pregnancy are inaccurate.  In this case, ultrasound-directed correction of the dates will typically yield a correct negative result.  In the case where the dates are correct, you will be offered counseling and an explanation of the result with a perinatologist.  You will be offered a level two ultrasound looking for features seen in Down's syndrome.  These are by no means diagnostic.  Amniocentesis is the gold standard for diagnosis.  This involves placing a needle into the uterus under ultrasound guidance and withdrawing amniotic fluid which can then be tested.</p>",,ob_q5,1
4,what_is_the_afp_test,1,"What is the AFP test, and should I get it done?","<p>The AFP test or Maternal Serum Alpha Fetoprotein test is a blood test of  three determinants. It also contains estriol and human chorionic gonadotropin. The purpose of this test is to determine the risk of the current pregnancy being affected by certain chromosomal problems such as Down's syndrome or variants of spina bifida. Most of the counseling regarding this test is focused on Down's syndrome because it is the most common of the few problems detectable with this test. </p>
  <p>Down's syndrome is a condition known to most people. It represents a group of problems which occur when there is an extra 21st chromosome. Down's syndrome patients have characteristic body changes such as short stature and mongoloid features. All are affected by variable levels of mental retardation. The risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome increases with maternal age. The risk at age 20 is 1/1,667; age 25 is 1/1,250; age 30 is 1/952; age 35 is 1/385; age 40 is 1/106 and age 45 is 1/30. </p>
  <p>The AFP, or triple screen test, is a screening test and is not diagnostic. It will not tell you if your baby has Down's syndrome or any other problem. The test will indicate whether you should be offered further testing. The formula used to derive the risk approximates the risk of a 35-year old. Thus, a 35 year old patient is screen positive  by virtue of age alone and will be offered further testing. Patients considered  high risk because of age or a positive triple screen test, will be offered  counseling with a perinatologist, ultrasound, and amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is the gold standard for diagnosis.<br>
      <br>
    The AFP or triple screen test is optional. If you do not desire any further prenatal diagnostic information, don't get the test. If you want all the prenatal diagnostic information you can get so that you may prepare yourself for a potential special needs child or would consider termination, then get the test.</p>",,ob_q4,1
3,expect_from_office_visit_during_pregnancy,1,What should I expect from my office visits during my pregnancy?,"<p>The first visit is the most involved because of the time spent gathering your complete history, conducting the physical exam  and completing the necessary blood work. Subsequent visits will occur monthly until you are 32 weeks; from 32 weeks to 36 weeks, they will occur every 2 weeks. After 36 weeks, your visits will be weekly until delivery. Additional visits during the pregnancy may include: </p>
<ul> 
  <li>12 weeks: first time to hear heartbeat.</li>
  <li>16 weeks: triple screen test containing Maternal serum Alpha Fetoprotein (MS-AFP), Estriol, HCG. <a href=""/faqs/what_is_the_afp_test"">More on AFP</a>. </li> 
  <li>18-20 weeks: ultrasound. </li> 
  <li>24-28 weeks: glucose test, and Rhogam given to RH- patients. </li> 
  <li>36 weeks: screening for GBS (Group B streptococcus). </li>

2,i_am_pregnant_what_should_i_do,1,I just found out I am pregnant. What should I do?,"<p>First of all, congratulations! We are excited for this miraculous event and look forward to sharing this exciting time with you. You need to call for a new OB appointment. We recommend the first OB appointment occurs within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Of course, we recommend you discontinue smoking and drinking any type of alcohol. You should take a prenatal vitamin with adequate folic acid. Most commercial prenatal vitamins contain a full milligram. This folic acid is most important in the first month of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The first OB appointment will be the most involved. During this visit, a complete history and physical exam will be done. A pap smear will be done if you are not current. Appropriate blood tests will be done, and you will be oriented to the office if you are unfamiliar with our facility and staff.</p>",,ob_q2,1
1,how_far_along_am_i,1,I think I am pregnant. How far along am I?,"<p>We date pregnancies from the first day of the previous menstrual cycle. Actual conception usually occurs around two weeks after that day. Sometimes, it is difficult to remember the last menstrual period, or the last period may have been atypical which calls into question the true gestational age. We do ultrasounds to confirm dates whenever there is any question.</p>","<h3>Estimate* Your Due Date</h3>
